**Short Explanations :** Every login (or reload), random colorscheme from *~/.colors/* folder will be loaded.
Window decorator, panel, terminal, startmenu, notifications, OSD popup, and desktop menu will use the same colourscheme from that random picked colouscheme.
If there is terminal window opened on `paintmybox` execution, the terminal colourscheme will be reloaded on the fly.
The wallpaper is also randomly picked from *~/.wallpaper/* folder.

## Packages
